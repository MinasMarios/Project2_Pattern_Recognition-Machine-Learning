# Project2_Pattern_Recognition-Machine-Learning

This repository contains the code and report for Project 2 of the Second Project in the course Pattern Recognision - Machine Learning offered by the National Kapodistrian University of Athens in the academic year 2021-2022. 

The project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to classify different types of images of people based on their facial features.

In addition, this repository also includes the solutions to two exercises:
- Exercise 1: Logistic Regression and Overfitting
- Exercise 2: Ridge Regression

## Data

The data used for this project is the [Yale B dataset](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database), which contains 2,414 images of 38 people under different lighting conditions. Each image is labeled with the identity of the person depicted.

## Code

The code for this project is contained in the `project2machinelearning.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which provides a detailed walkthrough of the project, including code and visualizations. The notebook loads the data, preprocesses the images, applies principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, trains and evaluates several machine learning models, performs hyperparameter tuning for the best performing model, and visualizes the decision boundary.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for more information on the project, as well as the solutions to the two exercises.
